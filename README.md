# Affordance Prediction from Object Names

This project uses machine learning to predict **object affordances**â€”such as `grasp`, `cut`, `contain`, or `scoop`â€”based solely on an object's **name** (e.g., "spoon", "hammer", "bowl"). The system takes a simple word or phrase as input and returns the set of likely affordances associated with it.

---

## Purpose of the Project

The ability to understand object affordances is a key component of **robotic reasoning**, **tool use**, and **human-robot interaction**. While traditional methods rely on visual perception or simulation, this project explores whether we can infer affordances using **only the name** of an object.

This project aims to:

- Demonstrate how **language can inform affordance inference**
- Provide a **lightweight affordance prediction module** that can integrate with robotic systems

---

## Features

- Multi-label classification using **Support Vector Machines**
- Text vectorization with **TF-IDF**
- Command-line and **FastAPI** interface
- Interactive **Streamlit web UI**
- Easily extendable for research, robotics, or educational use

## Dataset

I use a custom-built dataset (`data/dataset.csv`) with over **100 common objects**, each labeled with one or more affordances like:

```csv
object_name,affordances
knife,"grasp,cut"
bowl,"grasp,contain"
hammer,"grasp,pound"
```

Affordances are based on a validated set used in affordance and tool-use research.

## Example

**Input**:
```json
{ "object_name": "ladle" }
```

**Output**:
```json
{ "affordances": ["grasp", "scoop"] }
```
